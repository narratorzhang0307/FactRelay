## One-line pitch / 一句话介绍

### Chinese

Fact Atlas 是一个基于 Gonka 的可验证个人知识地图：用户主动提交主张，或由全球主题 Agent 发现新闻；FactRelay 与 Evidence Council 负责双模型核验，只把有证据与回执的知识落位到私人星球。

### English

Fact Atlas is a verifiable personal knowledge map on Gonka. Users bring claims or discover them through global topic agents; FactRelay and Evidence Council perform traceable multi-model review before a human chooses what enters the private Atlas.

## Project introduction / 项目介绍

### Chinese

社交媒体与生成式 AI 让信息生成变得廉价，但也让“为什么应该相信这个结论”变得更难回答。大多数 AI 事实核查产品仍只返回一段自信的文字，用户看不到模型是否真正使用了相关来源，也看不到不同模型之间的分歧。

Fact Atlas 提供两条知识路径：Relay 让用户主动提交书籍、电影、聊天、新闻或社交媒体中的主张；Signals 让 AI、科技、金融、气候能源、科学、健康、城市文化与公共政策等主题 Agent 每日扫描全球公开新闻，用 Gonka 完成第一道重要性筛选。该分数不是真实度判断。

用户选中候选主张后，FactRelay 检索当前公开证据，通过 GonkaRouter 让 Kimi-K2.6 担任调查方，让 MiniMax-M2.7 以质疑方角色检查循环引用、时间错位、因果跳跃和遗漏背景。最终 Truth Score 由确定性代码计算，并与来源账本、双模型推理、分歧程度和原始 Gonka Request ID 一起展示。Evidence Council 将记录、调查、质疑和人工确认分成四个责任清晰的环节。最后，地点必须由用户确认，不能确定的内容保留在未落位轨道。

FactRelay 不把推理回执当成“真理证明”；回执只证明哪一次 Gonka 请求生成了该分析。这种边界是产品诚信的一部分。

### English

Social media and generative AI have made information cheap to produce, but they have made one question harder to answer: why should anyone trust the verdict? Most AI fact checkers still return one confident paragraph. Users cannot see whether the cited material directly addresses the claim, whether two models independently agreed, or which inference calls produced the analysis.

FactRelay turns text, a public URL, or a screenshot into a traceable investigation. It retrieves current public evidence, sends the evidence packet to Kimi-K2.6 as the investigator, and asks MiniMax-M2.7 to act as an adversarial skeptic looking for source laundering, chronology errors, causal leaps, and omitted context. A deterministic scorer then produces the Truth Score from normalized model verdicts and source assessments. The interface keeps the evidence ledger, disagreement, execution path, and untouched upstream Gonka Request IDs visible.

FactRelay never claims that a request receipt proves a statement true. A receipt proves which Gonka request produced the analysis; factual support still comes from inspectable evidence.

## Technical description / 技术说明

### Architecture

```text
React client
  → Relay: user-supplied text / URL / image
  → Signals: eight topic agents + public-news retrieval
  → Node input validation and SSRF guard
  → public page + Google/Bing News RSS retrieval (non-AI)
  → Kimi signal ranking through GonkaRouter (discovery only)
  → Kimi investigator through GonkaRouter
  → MiniMax skeptic through GonkaRouter
  → JSON normalization and source-index validation
  → deterministic Truth Score
  → Evidence Council + evidence ledger + provenance trace
  → human-confirmed place candidate from OpenStreetMap Nominatim
  → private browser-local Fact Atlas on a Mapbox dark globe
```

### Gonka compliance / Gonka 合规性

- All semantic inference is sent to `https://api.gonkarouter.io/v1/chat/completions`.
- Visual claim extraction and investigator analysis use `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`.
- Daily topic agents use Kimi through GonkaRouter to rank news importance and preserve a separate upstream receipt; importance is never presented as truth.
- Adversarial cross-checking uses `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7`.
- The backend preserves the exact upstream `response.id` as `requestId`.
- Preview fixtures always use `requestId: null`; the project never fabricates realistic IDs.
- Retrieval uses public HTML and RSS, not another AI provider.
- The built-in Great Wall starter transparently adds live NASA, ESA, and Smithsonian pages to make the canonical demo resilient to news-search outages; generic claims still use the general live retrieval path.
- If a model returns malformed JSON, the same Gonka model receives one strict structured retry. The failed attempt remains visible as a partial trace step instead of being hidden.

### Truth Score / 评分公式

```text
combined signal = 55% model consensus + 45% source-weighted evidence
Truth Score      = 50 + 50 × combined signal
```

Each source is counted once, hallucinated source indexes are rejected, weak evidence pulls the score toward 50, and model disagreement lowers decision confidence.

### Safety / 安全

- Public HTTP(S) URLs only; loopback, private, link-local, and `.local` hosts are blocked.
- DNS results and redirect destinations are revalidated.
- Remote page content, source excerpts, and previous model drafts are treated as untrusted prompt data.
- Images are restricted to PNG/JPEG/WebP and approximately 5 MB.
- API keys remain server-side and are never exposed by the health route.
- The browser receives only a public Mapbox `pk.` token; Gonka credentials remain server-side.

| 01:42–02:02 | Gonka receipts and trust boundary | “所有语义推理只通过 GonkaRouter。每次调用保留上游 Request ID，但回执不冒充事实证明。” | Every Gonka inference keeps its upstream request ID; receipts do not replace evidence. |
| 02:02–02:22 | Atlas placement and globe | “最后由用户确认地点并写入私人知识星球。无法确定地点时，内容留在未落位轨道，系统不伪造坐标。” | Human-confirmed facts enter the private Atlas; uncertain locations remain unplaced. |
